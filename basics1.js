  //We cant redeclare variable with let keyword but possible with var. let c="dd" -->  not allowed in let but allowed in var
  //reaassigning is allowed with let. ->let c = 23.4 .. c="hello"
  //const is used when the value in the variable is constant that wont changed at any point of time. no reassigning, re declaring allowed.
